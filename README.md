When the project is cloned into the local system, get into the springbootServer directory and type the following command to start the server
> cd springbootServer
> mvn spring-boot:run



Now execute the following commands to start the client
> cd ..
> cd client
> npm install
> npm start


The application is now ready to run.
The server is running on the port 3000 and the client is running on the port 8080. The dropbox application should be automatically opened if the installations are successful.
